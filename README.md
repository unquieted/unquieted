unquieted, a WordPress theme
===

This `unquieted` theme for WordPress was developed for my freelance web development portfolio site.  It is in permanent beta. 

It was built using `underscores`. It also borrows from the `2017` theme and, especially, from the `hume` theme by [Morten Rand-Hendriksen](http://mor10.com).
